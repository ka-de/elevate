# elevate.py - Check your privileges!

**elevate.py** is a Python utility script that checks if the current script is running with administrative privileges. If not, it elevates the script's execution to run with admin rights on Windows. This is particularly useful when a script needs to perform tasks that require elevated privileges, such as modifying system settings or accessing protected directories.

## Usage

1. **Import the `elevate` module** into your Python script:

    ```python
    import elevate
    ```

2. **Check and elevate privileges** if needed by calling the `run_as_admin()` function:

    ```python
    elevate.run_as_admin()
    ```

3. Continue with your script's functionality, knowing that it's running with the necessary administrative rights.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use `elevate.py` in your Python script:

```python
import elevate

# Check and elevate privileges if needed
elevate.run_as_admin()

# Continue with your script...
```

## Important Notes

    This script is designed for Windows environments and uses the ctypes library to check and elevate privileges.

    Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run scripts with administrative privileges.

    Be cautious when running scripts with elevated privileges, as they can make significant changes to your system.
